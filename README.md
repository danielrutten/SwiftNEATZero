# SwiftNEATZero

SwiftNEAT Zero is a Swift implementation of NEAT, an elegant algorithm developed by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen while at The University of Texas at Austin for evolving neural networks through augmenting topologies.

SwiftNEAT Zero is the sugar free version of SwiftNEAT that is intended for educational purposes.

We're still working on the code and the accompanying tutorial, but feel free to take a sneak peak at the tutorial at https://clickwise.co.nz/an-idiots-journey-into-artificial-intelligence
